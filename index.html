<h2><a id="rental">Canoe Rentals</a></h2>

<p>If you are a non-member, you have the option to rent a canoe for:<br>
<strong>$35 for the day<br>
$25 for a half day (after 3 p.m. or under 3 hours)<br>
$15.00 for one hour<br></strong></p>

<p><strong><i>This price includes a tin canoe, paddles and lifejackets</i></strong></p>

<p><strong><strong>Equipment:</strong> Our canoes are aluminum with 2 seats. You may take a 3rd person sitting in the middle-bottom of the canoe.<br>
To prevent capsizing, ensure proper balance in the boat by distributing weight evenly.<br>
<br>
<strong>Safety Notes:</strong> Yes - Canoes do tip over. If you are not prepared for this to happen you should not go out. Windy conditions are also a factor, making it easier to tip.<br>
<br>
All paddlers must be confident they can swim if the canoe does tip over.<br></strong></p>

<ul>
 <li>Stay close to shore</li>

 <li>Stay close to the Clubhouse in poor weather conditions</li>

 <li>Please stay off the race course</li>

 <li>Give right of way to all other vessels on the reservoir (SS Moyie paddleboat, Rowers, Dragon Boats and competitive canoes and kayaks)</li>

 <li>Clothing suggestions: We suggest you wear clothing that is not restrictive in case you do get wet.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Please note:</strong> Rentals are first come first serve and no reservations are taken. With over 25 canoes we typically have plenty of boats. You can call ahead for those very warm, sunny weekend afternoons to check on availability if wanted. Reservoir bylaw also requires lifejackets to be worn at all times while on the Glenmore reservoir. An exception to the lifejacket bylaw includes paddling competitions amongst seasoned athletes.</p><br>

<p><strong>2014 Summer Learn to Paddle Program</strong></p>

<p>Our Youth Learn to Paddle Program offers an all around paddling experience. The program is geared to a two-week session. We feel that participants have the opportunity to experience all facets of paddling and become comfortable in the racing boats over this period of time. On water activities include paddling in recreation canoes, whitewater kayaks, sprint racing canoes and kayaks, the 14 person sprint war canoe, and 20 person dragon boat.<br>
<br>
Basic water safety is covered along with all the basics of the equipment and strokes and skills for the various boats.<br>
<br>
Dry land activities will make up the remainder of the day. The emphasis is on active games and events in and around the Clubhouse (soccer, capture the flag, the CCC amazing race, etc).<br>
<br>
We realize a one week program may be more suitable for some looking for a brief introduction to paddling. Therefore, participants may sign up for a one week session. We will offer limited spaces for one week camps. One week sessions are only available for the first week of all two week sessions.<br>
<br>
To register, choose which session you would like to start and for how many consecutive sessions you would like to participate in.<br>
<br>
All programs take place at the Calgary Canoe Club site. The Clubhouse offers an indoor paddling tank, hall area, and sprint bay specifically for camp participants. In poor weather situations we may move activities indoors.<br>
<br>
Pre and post care available from 8:30am - 5:30pm under the supervision of our boat bay staff, must note on your registration form.<br>

 <h2 id="faq">FAQs</h2>
 
 <p>
 Here are some FAQ's that you may have. If you have a question that is not answered please email calgarycanoeclubinfo@gmail.com or call the canoe club at 403-246-5757.<br><br><br>
 
<strong>Do we rent kayaks?</strong><br>
--No, you have to be a member. We only rent canoes. Please head to Canoe Rental Page for more info.<br><br><br>

<strong>Do we have touring or sea kayaks?</strong><br>
--No, only recreational kayaks. We purchased 25 new pyranna kayaks for 2014. Please go to U of C Outdoor Centre, Undercurrents, or Aquabatics for these types of boats.<br><br><br>

<strong>If you are a member or a non-member can you take the kayaks and canoes off-reservoir? </strong><br>
--Sorry, we do not allow equipment off the reservoir<br><br><br>

<strong>Where can I rent canoes/kayaks to take off-reservoir?</strong><br>
--Here are places you can rent: U of C Outdoor Centre, Undercurrents, or Aquabatics.<br><br><br>

<strong>Do we have trailers, roof racks, tie downs to rent or buy? </strong><br>
--The U of C Outdoor Center rents trailers, roof racks, and tie downs. Undercurrents rent/buy roof racks and tie downs. Aquabatics carries roof racks and tie downs to buy.<br><br><br>

<strong>When members bring guests do they need to leave a deposit? </strong><br>
--No, however, they need to fill out a waiver form. Also, if they are using a boat themselves they need to pay $5/half day, $10/full day.<br><br><br>

<strong>Can we open the gate so you can drive down or does it cost anything to use the Canoe/Rowing Club dock? </strong><br>
--We are unable to open the CCC/CRC gate to allow people to drive down to the water as it is Emergency Access only. It does not cost anything to use the dock but the CCC/CRC docks in North Glenmore Park are the most congested docks on the Glenmore Reservoir. Parking can be problematic and during regatta’s access to the public is restricted. We suggest using the Calgary Yacht Club or Calgary Sailing Club dock as you can drive down and they are not as congested as the CCC/CRC docks.<br><br><br>

<strong>Can I store my boat here? </strong><br>
--No, you may call 311 or the City of Calgary for boat storage at the Calgary Yacht Club or the Calgary Sailing Club.<br><br><br>

<strong>Do we rent picnic sites for North Glenmore Park? </strong><br>
--We do not handle picnic sites the City of Calgary does. Call 311 or go to the City of Calgary website for North Glenmore Park.<br><br><br>

<strong>Do we do private, group, or corporate lessons? </strong><br>
--Yes, we do, please call or email us to book a session and we will provide a quote based on your lesson.<br><br><br>

<strong>Can you Stand Up Paddle Board on the Glenmore Reservoir?</strong><br>
--No you cannot, see city bylaws for more info.See Undercurrents, Aquabatics, and/or MEC to find courses and where to paddle board around Calgary and area.<br><br><br>

<strong>Do I need to wear a PFD at all times, can I bring my dog with me in my canoe, or can I swim in the reservoir? </strong><br>
--The Glenmore reservoir provides drinking water to a large portion of Calgary residents therefore a few bylaws must be adhered to, they are: No swimming in the reservoir. No dogs allowed on or around the reservoir. You must wear a DOT approved PFD at all times.<br><br><br>

<strong>Is the reservoir shut down all the time in the spring? </strong><br>
--Several factors will contribute to this decision: </p>
<ol>
<li>During high river flow periods, typical at this time of year, the level is lowered to accommodate the flow from upstream of the dam to mitigate the potential of flooding. As a result, The City of Calgary Boat Patrol is unable to launch their craft, preventing them from responding to calls for assistance. </li>
<li>
There may be an excessive amount of large floating, and semi-submerged debris in the reservoir creating hazardous conditions.3. Highly turbid water obscures hazards below the surface and makes it extremely difficult to search underwater.</li>

<strong>How old do you need to be to rent a canoe?</strong><br>
-- 16 years of age and you need to have your parent/guardian sign waiver form and supervise you while you are paddling.<br><br><br>

<strong>How many orientation sessions can you do for Outrigger paddling or Sprint Kayak/Canoe? </strong><br>
-- 2 sessions (with a $5 donation per session) and then you need to decide if you would like to join the program and pay fees.<br><br><br>
